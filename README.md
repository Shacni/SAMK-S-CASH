**Smart. Simple. Spoken.**  
A voice- and photo-powered income & expense tracker for small traders.

## 🎯 About the Project

Samk’s Cash is a human-centered, joy-driven mobile/web app built for small-scale traders and informal business owners. Many of them don't track their daily earnings or purchases — which makes it hard to know whether they’re making a profit.

This app makes it effortless to **track income and expenses** using **voice input or photos**, eliminating the need for typing or complex bookkeeping.

> “Talk. Snap. Track. Grow.”
